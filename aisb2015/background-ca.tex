\cite{langton1990computation,mitchell1993revisiting,packard1988adaptation}
are the classic works on ``edge of chaos'' effects.  In
\cite{packard1988adaptation,mitchell1993revisiting,mitchell1994evolving},
genetic algorithms are used to search the space of CA rules
via crossover and mutation.  This sort of evolution is global and
is not connected

\cite{hofstadter1995prolegomena,marshall1999metacat} took a rather
different but still somewhat related approach.
