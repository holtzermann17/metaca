\part{Background}
\frame{\partpage}

\begin{frame}{Cellular Automata}{}\label{intro-to-ca}
Each elementary 1-dimensional cellular automaton (1D CA) corresponds to a mapping from all eight \emph{triples} formed of
0's and 1's to the set \{0,1\}.
Thus, for example the rule $\mathbf{01010100}$
is defined as the following operation:
\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{l@{\hskip -.07in}p{2.5in}}
\begin{fminipage}{1.6in}
\lstinputlisting{exampleca.tex}
\end{fminipage} &
\raisebox{.2in}{\begin{minipage}{2.5in}
The rules determine the next generation of a 1D CA locally, where each cell inherits from three ``parents''.

\medskip

In the example,
\boxed{0\mystrut}\boxed{0\mystrut}\boxed{0\mystrut} $\mapsto$
\boxed{0\mystrut} and
\boxed{0\mystrut}\boxed{0\mystrut}\boxed{1\mystrut} $\mapsto$
\boxed{1\mystrut} and so on.
\end{minipage}}
\end{tabular}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Cellular Automata, ctd.}{}
%% These rules can then be used to fill in a 2-dimensional grid, by
%% starting by creating a row of cells with fixed values at the top, and
%% defining a suitable condition on the edges, for example, saying they
%% are always \boxed{0\mystrut}.  We usually depict \boxed{0\mystrut} as
%% \framebox(8,8){} and \boxed{1\mystrut} as $\blacksquare$.

A {\fontspec{Bookhands}MetaCA } evolves a cellular automaton with \emph{{\color{red}2}{\color{LimeGreen}5}{\color{blue}6}} ($=2^8$) possible
states -- rather than the traditional 2, \framebox(8,8){} and $\blacksquare$.

We realised we could apply a more ``COINVENTish'' rule to build
``blending'' into the multiplication.  If the two neighbours are the
same, simply use their common value as the final result, otherwise apply
the local rule to that allele, as above.

% [O]bjects are constituted in terms of meanings within the social process of experience and behavior through the mutual adjustment to one another of the responses or actions of the various individual organisms involved in that process, an adjustment made possible by means of a communication which takes the form of a conversation of gestures in the earlier evolutionary stages of that process, and of language in its later stages.

% [A] gesture is a symbol of the result of the given social act of one organism (the organism making it) in so far as it is responded to by another organism (thereby also involved in that act) as indicating that result.

``Chemists have pointed out that even in the organic---not to go so far as the organized---science has reconstructed hitherto nothing but waste products of vital activity; the peculiarly active plastic substances obstinately defy synthesis.  One of the most notable naturalists of our time has insisted on the opposition of two orders of phenomena observed in living tissues, \emph{anagenesis} and \emph{katagenesis}.

%% To sum up, those who are concerned only with the functional activity of the living being are inclined to believe that physics and chemistry will give us the key to biological processes.  They have chiefly to do, as a fact, with phenomena that are \emph{repeated} continually in the living being, as in a chemical retort. This explains, in some measure, the mechanistic tendencies of physiology.  On the contrary, 
``Those whose attention is concentrated on the minute structure of living tissues, on their genesis and evolution, histologists and embryogenists on the one hand, naturalists on the other, are interested in the retort itself, not merely in its contents. They find that this retort creates its own form through a \emph{unique} series of acts that really constitute a \emph{history}.''\quad \raisebox{-.2cm}{\fontspec{Bookhands}Bergson}
