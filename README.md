This code creates "meta-" cellular automata spacetime diagrams.  That
is, the CA's evolve their own rules locally, rather than evolving an
abstract state according to one global rule.  A MetaCA can be coupled
(in one or both directions) with a standard CA.

Previous work with cellular automata feature evolving global rules,
including the recent work on PICARD by Theodore Pavlic et al.  The
current work is the first example that I am aware of that evolves the
evolutionary rule locally.

In addition to these 1D examples, our paper (and slides) presented at
AISB'15 consider 2D examples.  The code for those experiments is in
[ewenmaclean/2dCA](https://github.com/ewenmaclean/2dCA).
