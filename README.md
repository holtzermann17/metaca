This code creates "meta-" cellular automata spacetime diagrams.  That
is, the CA's evolve their own rules locally, rather than evolving an
abstract state according to one global rule.  A MetaCA can be coupled
(in one or both directions) with a standard CA.

Previous work with cellular automata feature evolving global rules,
including the recent work on PICARD by Theodore Pavlic et al.  The
current work is the first example that I am aware of that evolves the
evolutionary rule locally.
