This code creates "meta-" cellular automata spacetime diagrams.
That is, the CA's evolve their own rules locally, rather evolving
an abstract state according to one global rule.

Previous work with CAs feature evolving global rules.  This is the
first work that I am aware of that evolves the rule locally.
